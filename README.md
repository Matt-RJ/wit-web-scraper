# wit-web-scraper

This a simple web scraper which checks for when the WIT exam results are up for semester 1 of 2019/2020.

The page in question states that the results will be up at a certain time, however, the results very frequently go up much sooner than that.

This sctipt checks for whether the page has been updated every 30 seconds, and sends a MacOS notification once this is the case.
